# Restaurant Table Reservation System

## About the system
The Restaurant Table Reservation System is designed to streamline the booking and
management of restaurant tables by providing a centralized database for storing reserva-
tions, allowing customers to book tables in advance, and enabling real-time tracking of
table availability. This system helps restaurants optimize seating arrangements, minimize
wait times, and enhance the overall dining.

## Key Features

-**Table Management**
  - Add, edit, and delete tables with details like table number, capacity, and location.
  - View available tables for a specific date and time.

-**Reservation Management**
  - Book, cancel, and view reservations for specific dates or time ranges.

-**Customer Management**
  - Add, update, and delete customer details, including name, contact number, and email.

-**Reporting**
  - Generate reports on daily or weekly reservation schedules, peak hours, and regular customers.

## Technologies Used

-  **java {Eclipse IDE}**: To implment the system
-  **XAMPP**: To use apache to create local server and to use Mycql to create database

  # Developer Guide
 ## 1.Project Structure

  The project is organized into the following packages and classes:
  
  ### Packages:
  #### `restaurant_system` :  Contains the main application classes.
  - `MainWindow`: The main application window with a tabbed interface.
  - `DatabaseConnection`: Handles database connectivity.
  - `TableManagementPanelDAO`: Manages table operations.
  - `ReservationManagementPanelDAO`: Manages reservation operations.
  - `CustomerManagementPanelDAO`: Manages customer operations.
  - `ReportingPanel`: Generates and exports reports.
#
## 2. Database Schema

The system uses a MySQL database named restaurantdb. Below is the schema

### Tables:

1.`Tables`:
- `table_id` (Primary Key)
- `table_number`
- `capacity`
- `location`
- `status` (e.g., available, occupied)
2. `Customers`:
- `customer_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `phone`
- `email`

3. `Reservations`:
  - `reservation_id` (Primary Key)
  - `table_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `customer_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `reservation_time`
  - `duration`

## 3.System Maintenance

### 3.1 Database Management
- Backup Regularly: Use tools like `mysqldump` or phpMyAdmin to back up the database.
- Optimize Queries: Ensure SQL queries are optimized for performance. Use indexing for frequently queried columns.
- Monitor Performance: Use tools like MySQL Workbench to monitor query performance and resolve bottlenecks.

### 3.2 Code Maintenance
  - Refactoring: Regularly refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
  - Error Handling: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
  - Logging: Implement logging using frameworks like Log4j to track errors and debug information.

### 3.3 Security Practices
  - Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
  - Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data like customer emails and phone numbers.
  - Secure Credentials: Store database credentials securely using environment variables or encrypted configuration files.
      
## 4. Future Enhancements
  ### 4.1 User Authentication
  - Implement a login system for restaurant staff and customers.
  - Add role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Staff, Customer).
        
  ### 4.2 Online Booking Portal
  - Develop a web-based interface for customers to book tables online.
  - Add real-time table availability updates.
        
  ### 4.3 Payment Integration
  - Integrate payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe for advance payments.
  - Implement refund management for canceled reservations.
        
  ### 4.4 Advanced Reporting
  - Add revenue tracking and customer feedback analysis.
  - Provide insights into table utilization rates and peak hours.

## How To Use
Download and install XAMPP on your computer from this link https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Download and install mysql connector java from this link https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

Setup Instructions

### XAMPP

1.Start Apache and MySQL:
- After successfully installing XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel.
- Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking the "Start" buttons for each.


2.Create a new database:
- Go back to the XAMPP Control Panel and click Admin next to the MySQL service.
- This will open phpMyAdmin in your browser.
- Click New in the left sidebar to create a new database.
- you must Name the database as this "restaurantdb" 


3.Import the SQL file:
- After creating the database, click on the database name (restaurantdb) in the left sidebar.
- Go to the Import tab at the top.
- Click Choose File and select the SQL file associated with the project.
- Click the Go button to import the SQL file.
- Note: Ensure the required tables.

### Mysql Connector Java

1.Select the operating system:
- On the page, you will find the option "Select Operating System." Choose "Platform Independent" if you want to download the JAR file directly

2.Choose the Connector/J version:
- A list of available versions will appear. Select the version you want (usually, it's best to choose the latest stable version)

3.Click "Download":
- After selecting the version, click the "Download" button next to it.

4.Choose the download method:
- click on the link "No thanks, just start my download" at the bottom of the page.

5.Save the file:
- The download of the file `mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.zip` will begin. Save the file to the desired folder on your computer.

6.Extract the file:
- Once the download is complete, extract the compressed file. Inside the folder, you will find the `mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar` file.

7.Add the file to your project:
- If you are working on a Java project, add the `JAR` file to your project's build path (classpath). You can do this manually or using tools like Maven or Gradle.
